description: Just North of the U of Minnesota and near the newest and coolest shopping in the Northern “burbs” Brightonwood Flats is in the center of it all. Less than 10 minutes from the “U” and equally close to Bethel University you can rent much more for less. There is a covered bus stop to downtown Minneapolis that is very close to your front door. Check out Brightonwood Flats today!
