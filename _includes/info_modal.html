This information is offered so that all applicants will have available to them a detailed statement of the rental qualifying policies adopted by Kramer/Saxl Group, LLC
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Although we have attempted to make this document easy to read and understand, it does include formal language and legal terms. If you have any questions regarding our policies or about the information contained in this document, please contact any member of our management team.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                       Enclosed are the current rental criteria for Brightonwood Flats, Broadway West Apartments, Tanabrik Apartments, and the Kramer/Saxl Group, LLC. Nothing contained in the requirements shall constitute a guarantee or representation by us that all residents who inhabit the community have met all of the requirements; there may be residents or occupants who have resided on the premises prior to the inception of these requirements. Additionally, our ability to verify whether these requirements have been met is limited to the information we receive from various consumer reporting services used by us.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Equal Housing Opportunity</h3>
                     <p>Kramer/Saxl Group, LLC provides an equal housing opportunity to all. We abide by all fair-housing practices and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap/disability, national origin, familial status, ancestry, age, marital status, source of income, sexual orientation or other factors unrelated to an applicant’s ability to comply with the rental agreement and community policies.</p>

                      <h3>PETS</h3>

                       <p>The current policy of Kramer/Saxl Group, LLC; Brightonwood Flats; Broadway West and Tanabrik is to allow, with the approval of management, up to two domestic cats, a bird, or fish in aquariums/fish-bowls. Otherwise no pets are allowed; that includes, but is not limited to, dogs, ferrets, exotic animals and reptiles.</p>

                       <h3>APPLICATION FEE</h3>

                       <p>Application fees are waived with applications that include a holding fee that will be applied to the security deposit. Each applicant over the age of 18 must fill out an application for residency. If an application is approved, the holding deposit/fee is applied to the security deposit account. Any applications that are not approved will have their holding deposit returned. If a holding deposit is not paid, then an application fee will be charged. Application fees are absolutely non-refundable.</p>

                       <h3>MINIMUM AGE</h3>

                      <p>All applicants must be at least 18 years old. Any minor who will occupy the apartment on a regular basis must be listed on the application and must be under the direct supervision of the adult applicant(s).</p>

                       <h3>POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION</h3>

                       <p>All applicants over the age of 18 must provide at least one form of identification. Applicants must have a valid current driver’s license or another form of government-issued identification and, if possible, one additional form of identification. The request for a photo ID is solely for the purpose of verifying identification.</p>

                       <h3>SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER</h3>

                       <p>Each applicant should have a Social Security number in order for the verification process to begin.</p>

                       <h3>CREDIT</h3>

                       <p>A credit report, eviction history and criminal history will be processed on each applicant DIRECTLY FROM OUR OWN REPORTING AGENCY. An unsatisfactory report can disqualify an applicant from renting an apartment at this community. An unsatisfactory report is one that reflects past or current bad debt, late payments or unpaid bills, liens, judgments or bankruptcies. Any applicant with a bankruptcy not showing as discharged is denied until shown otherwise. Applicants with discharged bankruptcies must show positive credit since discharge. Applicants with little or no credit history may be required to pay an additional security deposit provided they meet the other criteria listed in this document.</p>

                       <h3>RESIDENT/RENTAL HISTORY</h3>

                       <p>Complete information regarding the last 5 years of your resident/rental history must be provided on your application. If you owned any places of residence, then information regarding your mortgage lender should be substituted for landlord information, along with the loan number. If there is no rental history, applicant still may be accepted if all applicants meet top acceptable threshold. If you have been evicted within the last 3 years, or if you have a landlord/tenant judgment against you or if you have a judgment in which you owe a previous landlord money, your application could be denied. Any unfavorable response regarding rental history, or inaccurate/false information regarding rental history, could result in your application being denied. These criteria include, but are not limited to: records of disturbance of neighbors; destruction of property; living or housekeeping habits at prior residence that may adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of other residents; illegal occupants, or unauthorized pets.</p>

                       <h3>INCOME REQUIREMENTS</h3>

                       <p>Exceptions are made for students or others who are enrolled in a formal education program.
                         Applicants must have a source of gross monthly income (before taxes and other deductions) of at least 2.5 (two and a half) to 3 (three) times the monthly rent of the apartment being leased. (Example: Rent is $735.00 X 3 = 2205.00. The applicant must have a monthly gross income of at least $2205.00.)</p>

                      <p>Each roommate must have a gross income source that is at least 3 (three) times 50% (half) of the monthly rent. (Example: Rent is $735.00 divided by 2 = 367.50 X 3 = $1102.50, so each roommate must have a monthly gross income of at least $1102.50, Again, exceptions are made for students working with student loans for income.)</p>

                       <h3>EMPLOYMENT/SOURCE OF INCOME</h3>

                       <p>Applicant must have a stable income or employment that meet income criteria for a minimum of 12 months preceding the date of application. All employment used to meet income criteria is subject to verification, including salary amount, state, date and length of employment.

                         If an individual fails to meet the income requirement but has at least 12 times rent in savings or liquid assets, the income requirement is considered to be met. Special arrangements can be made for students or others going through transition.</p>

                       <h3>CRIMINAL HISTORY</h3>

                       <p>Your name and identity will be checked against records of law-enforcement agencies.

                         Management expressly reserves the right to reject any application if an applicant has been convicted by a court or competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture, distribution, possession or current use of a controlled substance as defined under applicable federal or state law.

                         Management also reserves the right to reject any application if an applicant has a record of criminal conviction(s) that involve a threat to health or safety of other individuals.

                         Management reserves the right to reject any application if an applicant poses a clear and present threat of substantial harm to others or the dwelling or property itself.

                         Management reserves the right to place a hold on any application from an applicant who has charges pending until final disposition of the case.</p>

                       <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>

                       <p>Kramer/Saxl Group, LLC maintains a strict policy of confidentiality and privacy for our applicants and residents. We do not discuss information on applications with anyone other than the applicant or resident. In addition we do not discuss individual credit reports with an applicant. If you would like to discuss or dispute any information contained in your credit report, you will need to contact the consumer-reporting agency at which the report was created. We will provide you with the name and address of that consumer-reporting agency upon written request.</p>

                       <h3>AVAILABILITY</h3>

                       <p>Properties become available when they are ready to rent. A vacant unit will not be deemed available until it has been cleaned and prepared for the new resident. We update our list of upcoming available units as notices are received. An upcoming available unit that was not published in the morning may become published later that same day.</p>

                       <h3>VALIDITY PERIOD</h3>

                       <p>Approved applications remain in good standing for a period of 90 days from the approval date. If the lease is not signed and/or the applicant fails to occupy an apartment within the viable time period, the application must be re-submitted for verification and approval, and a new application fee must be paid.</p>

                       <h3>OCCUPANCY GUIDELINES</h3>

                       <p>All occupants must be listed on the lease agreement. No more than two occupants may reside per bedroom. The maximums are: 1 person in a studio,  two people in a 1-bedroom apartment,  four in a 2 bedroom (but not more than 3 adults)  and four in a 3 bedroom (with no more than 3 adults and 4 people in total). This is to allow maximum opportunities for housing, for families with children, but to minimize the problems with guests and parking that occur with multiple adult roommates.
                         </p>
                       <h3>DEMEANOR AND BEHAVIOR</h3>

                       <p>The demeanor or behavior of rental applicants during the application process will be considered as part of your application and evaluated in the sole opinion of Kramer/Saxl, LLC. The application process requires the presence of all occupants for the application interview.</p>

                       <h3>BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP</h3>

                       <p>The relationship between Management and our residents is a business relationship. A courteous and business like attitude is required from both parties. We reserve the right to refuse rental to anyone who is verbally abusive, uses profanity, is disrespectful, makes threats, has been drinking, is argumentative, or in general displays an attitude at the time of the unit showing or application process that causes the Management to believe we would not have a positive business relationship.</p>

                       <h3>WE ARE A FAIR HOUSING PROVIDER</h3>

                       <p>We do not discriminate against persons on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, disability, creed, marital, status, public assistance, ancestry, and sexual or affectional orientation.

                         To maximize your chance of approval and to expedite the process, please take the time to fill in your application as completely and accurately as possible. If something does not apply, use N/A in that spot. Incomplete applications and false/inaccurate information will result in the rejection of your application.

                         Once we receive your application, application fee and copies of required income information, we will begin processing your application. This process can take up three business days.</p>
